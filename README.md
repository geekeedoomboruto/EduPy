# EduPy
Python, simpler
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- (You can use it with Python 2.7 but you will have to change the <code>shell_v2.py</code>)
# Example of simple code
<pre>
// In EduPy
i = 0
until i > 3
  put(i)
  i++
</pre>
<pre>
# In Python
i = 0
while not i > 3:
  print(i)
  i+=1
</pre>
EduPy is much easier
