# EduPy
Python, simpler
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- (You can use it with Python 2.7 but you will have to change the <code>shell_v2.py</code>)
# Example of simple code
<pre>
// In EduPy
i = 0
until i > 3
  put(i)
  i++
</pre>
<pre>
# In Python
i = 0
while not i > 3:
  print(i)
  i+=1
</pre>
EduPy is much easier
# How to excute a file writen in EduPy
The command is <code>python exec.py execute 'filename'</code>
Let's suppose that you have a file named <code>randomfile.epy</code>, you will do <code>python exec.py execute 'randomfile.epy'</code> to execute it! Don't worry, i'm gonna try to make the command shorter
# Avantages
## EduPy is flexible
 - You have the choice to use <code>:</code>, <code>{}</code> or nothing!
## It is fully compatible with Python
 - You can write Python code, it will execute it the same way
## It's easier than a lot of other languages
 - More easier than Python, and it's a real programming language, it is one of the best and easiest languages in the world, best because of python and easiest because of it's syntax
## It's useful
 - Most of the time, when someone tries to create a language, it comes with only some builtins stuff and no support of the community, because EduPy is writen in Python, you get access to the Anaconda libraries and PyPi libraries!
